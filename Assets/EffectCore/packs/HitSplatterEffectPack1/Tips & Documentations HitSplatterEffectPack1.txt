Tips and tutorials: Hit Splatter Effect Pack #1 

How to make new colored effects

1. Copy the template folder (HitSplatterEffectPack1/prefabs/"what you want to copy"/Template"what you want to copy")
2. Drag out the prefab into the sceneview
3. Open up the tabs in particleColorChanger script and start changing the color values.
4. Use apply check to apply color or turn on the keep_apply changes.
5. Save prefab

Optimization tips:
Disabling components is the way to go, all particles can be reduced in emittion if needed. 
(Inside the Particle System, Emission, lower the count in burst or time, spawns less particle).

PS: I apolgize for having DestroyMe Scripts on the effects, this so I can test the effects.
The unity scene might lag if you have to many effects with the colorchange script keep_apply feature applied.
